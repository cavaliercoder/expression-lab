# Expression Lab

Expression Lab is a lightweight Windows application based on the .Net Framework 4.0 that allows you to test regular
expression (.Net flavour) patterns with real time results displayed on your target data.

Regular Expressions, or ‘Regex/Regexp’ are patterns used to match text data as desired. Expression Lab allows you to
enter your targeted data (Eg. a CSV or XML file, a product list or programming code) and develop a search pattern to
describe the subset of information you require with real time results shown as colored highlights over your target data.
Each match also details its index in the collection of match results to help you find the same results in your .Net
code.
